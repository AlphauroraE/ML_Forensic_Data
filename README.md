# ML_Forensic_Data

This repo consists of the code for my Statistics for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence course, homework 5.

The first part of this assignment consists of forensic data.

The second part of this assignment works with data from the [MAGIC Gamma Telescope](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/159/magic+gamma+telescope)

Next steps:
- I anticipate kNN and the two SVM models to be easy to implement. Review LDA.
